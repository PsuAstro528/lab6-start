    "## Parallelization for Multi-Core Workstations (using multiple processes)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hardware configuration for this exercise\n",
    "In this lab exercise, we'll explore a few different ways that we can parallelize calculations across multiple cores of a single workstation or server.  Some of the syntax and programming patterns are very similar as to what you'll use later when we parallelize our code for distributed computing (i.e., over a number of processors that do not have direct access to the same memory.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Fortunately, most modern workstations and even laptops have multiple cores.  As of Fall 2023, most of Roar Collab's \"standard\" compute nodes have 48 cores.  (The high-memory nodes have 40 cores. Basic cores have 80 cores.  Various GPU nodes have 24-48 CPU cores.)  \n",
    "\n",
    "For this exercise, it's important that you actually have access to multiple processor cores.  If you're using Julia installed on your own machine, then you don't need to do anything special before starting the lab.  However, if you're using the Roar Collab portal to access the Jupyter Lab server, then you will need to have requested multiple processor cores when you first submited the request for the BYOE JupyterLab server using the box labeled \"Number of Cores\", i.e. _before you start executing cells in this notebook_.  Here's a [screenshot](images/portal_screenshot.png) showing the screen where you specify multiple cores.  \n",
    "\n",
    "While we're in class, please ask for just 4 cores, since there are many of us using the system at once.  \n",
    "If you return to working on the lab outside of class (and not right before the deadline), then feel free to try benchmarking the code using 8 cores, 12 or even 16 cores.  If you do ask for several cores, then please be extra diligent about deleting your session via the Roar Collab Portal when you're done, so they become avaliable to other members of the class."

    "### Why Jupyter?\n",
    "For this exercise, we're using a Jupyter notebook, instead of a Pluto notebook.  Why?\n",
    "In the previous exercise, we parallelized our code using one process that organized its computation into multiple threads, all within a Pluto notebook.  Pluto worked well for that kind of parallelism.  In contrast, for this exercise, we're going to parallelize our code using multiple processes. \n",
    "Pluto already uses multiple processes to analyze, run and display the Pluto notebook, so you can't (easily) parallelize your code over multiple processes within a Pluto notebook environment.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Since each Jupyter notebook is executed using a separate Julia kernel, they are more ammenable to parallelization via multiple processes.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Multi-process vs Multi-threading\n",
    "As discussed in [the previous exercise](https://psuastro528.github.io/lab6-start/ex1.html), both approaches are viable ways to parallelize code over multiple processors contained within one workstation/compute node/server.  Multiple threads within a single process all have access to the memory that the operating system (OS) has assigned to that process.  However, different processes are assigned separate memory locations.  While it is possible to send data from one process to another, it needs to be done explicitly.  For simples codes, I usually start with multi-threading, as it tends to be a little easier to implement and is often more efficient.  For more complex codes (e.g., integrating PDEs), there can be advanages to using multiple processes (e.g., reducing need for memory locks).  However, the main reason I want students to get experience parallelizing code using multiple processes is that this apporach is necessary to scale up the level parallelism to use more compute cores than exist in compute node.  If we write (and test) our code to run in parallel using multiple processes on one workstation, then there will be relatively little work to implement a distributed memory parallelization.  \n",

The original process is now in charge of delegating the work amongst the worker processes. (Historically, this process was referred to as the \"master process\", and you're likely to still that terminology in online documentation and questions.  I'll try to use the \"delegator process\" instead.)  When you have a lot of workers, it's often advantageous to let one process focus on managing all the communications and other overhead associated with parallelization.  That way the worker processes are likely to stay more nearly in sync, rather than having to repeatedly wait for the delegator process to catch up.  On the other hand, if there is relatively little overhead work for the delegator process, then it is often useful to set the number of workers equal to the number of available CPU cores, even though that means one process will have to do a little more work than the others.

When an operation is to be parallelized, this information can be used to spread the work over the worker processes.  \n",

This can be useful even if your job could in principle be run on a single node with $N$ processor cores.  If you submit a job that requires $N$ processor cores on the same node, then your job is likely to wait in the queue longer than it you submit a job that requires $N$ processor cores that could be spread over multiple compute nodes.  If you want to make use a very large number of cores (e.g., using a cloud provider like Amazon AWS, Google Compute Engine, Microsoft Azure), then you'll need to use a distributed memory system.  For a long time, [MPI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Message_Passing_Interface) was the most common way to use distributed memory systems.  If you're programming with C/C++ or Fortran, then you will likely still be using MPI.
